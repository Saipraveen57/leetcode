Find the repeating and missing numbers
Problem Statement: You are given a read-only array of N integers with values 
also in the range [1, N] both inclusive. Each integer appears exactly once except 
A which appears twice and B which is missing. The task is to find the repeating and 
missing numbers A and B where A repeats twice and B is missing.

Input Format:  array[] = {3,1,2,5,3}

Result: {3,4)

Explanation: A = 3 , B = 4 
Since 3 is appearing twice and 4 is missing

//Below is the code for the above problem
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int[] input = new int[]{3,1,2,5,4,6,7,5};
		int[] dummy_array=new int[input.length];
		int missing_number=0;
		int repeating_number=0;
		int count=0;
		int count_for_repeating_number=0;
		int count_for_missing_number=0;
		
		//the below code is to find the repeating number in the array
		for(int i=1; i<=input.length;i++){
		    count_for_repeating_number=0;
		    for(int j=0;j<input.length;j++){
    		    if(input[j]==i){
    		        dummy_array[count]=i;
    		        count++;
    		        count_for_repeating_number++;
    		    }
		    }
		    if(count_for_repeating_number==2){
		        repeating_number=i;
		    }
		}
		
		//this below code is for finding the missing number in the array
		for(int i=1;i<=input.length;i++){
		    count_for_missing_number=0;
		    for(int j=0;j<input.length;j++){
		        if(dummy_array[j]==i)
		            count_for_missing_number++;
		    }
		    if(count_for_missing_number==0){
		        missing_number=i;
		    }
		}
		
		//output of repeating and missing numbers with space separated
		System.out.println(repeating_number+" "+missing_number);
	}
}
